# hackVille2022
The official Hackville Repository for TimeSavior


Inspiration

Our inspiration came from the recent chaotic organizational challenges of online education while juggling multiple courses.
What it does

The current build takes tasks from the user and sends them to a custom script which returns suggests weekdays for completing each task.
How we built it

We built this project using Spring Boot and GitHub as our version control platform. We collaborated on Discord and we tried using Heroku to deploy the site to a custom domain name but that did not end up working out :(
Challenges we ran into

We ran into multiple challenges including GitHub issues that came up from improper use of certain functions, but our biggest task ended up being getting and manipulating SQL rows to store them as Java objects for logic testing.
Accomplishments that we're proud of

We are proud that we completed this submission in time, even though we pushed around 5am!!
What we learned

We learned that collaboration is key when it comes to any programming project. This aspect becomes even more important under the time constraints that we were exposed to this weekend!
What's next for TimeSavior

Next, we need to implement an interface for a user to input his availability for each day of the week for an even more personalized suggestions. The algorithm currently runs on a preset availability schedule for testing purposes.

We would also need to properly deploy the site so it can be used by the public.
